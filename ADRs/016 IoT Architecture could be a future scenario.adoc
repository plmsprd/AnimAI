# IoT Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Discussion

The requirements tell us to not consider video uploads from the camera due to remote usage.

Some machine learning platforms encourage the connection directly from the microcontroller.
If there was a resonable good internet connection, short videos and pictures could likely be uploaded directly. 

## Decision 

We will mention it for future scenarios to have a tighter integration of the camera.
