With the cost factor at the top of our list, we excluded space-based and microservices. We excluded event-driven due to costs and complexity.

The remaining ones were hardes to choose, but we excluded microkerner, layered monolith and modular monolith based on scalability.

We chose Service-based Architecture because of better scalability and performance, even though the costs are slightly higher, making it more future-proof.
