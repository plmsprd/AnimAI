# ADR-014 Selected Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
1. With the cost factor at the top of our list, we excluded **space-based** and **microservices**. 
2. We excluded **event-driven** due to costs and complexity.
3. The remaining ones were harder to choose, but we excluded **microkerner**, **layered monolith** and **modular monolith** based on scalability.
4. We chose **Service-based Architecture** because of better scalability and performance, even though the costs are slightly higher, making it more future-proof. 
Trade-offs for **service-based architectures** to be aware: testing is harder than microservices and the deployment pipeline needs more coordination. 
service-based doesn't support elasticity very well, but this is not needed. Service-based has the advantage of expanding one domain without affecting another domain
while keeping cost and complexity low.

## Decision
