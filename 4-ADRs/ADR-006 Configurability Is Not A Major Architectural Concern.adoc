# ADR-006 Configurability Is Not A Major Architectural Characteristic

## Status
Accepted

## Context
From the use cases, users only adjust camera settings, system admins may have system authorization configurations, there is no much configuraion needed in the system.

## Decision
No, camera is a blackbox, we don't need separate configurations on backend.
