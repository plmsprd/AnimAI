# ADR-005 Workflow Is Not An Important Architectural Characteristic

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Since the system does not need much human intervention, the procedure for each operation is relatively short, thus, there is no complex/lengthy process that should be highly focused. 

## Decision
No. No complex workflows are necessary
