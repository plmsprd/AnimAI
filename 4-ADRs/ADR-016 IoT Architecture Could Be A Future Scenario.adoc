# ADR-016 IoT Architecture Could Be A Future Scenario

## Status
Accepted

## Context
1. The requirements tell us to not consider video uploads from the camera due to remote usage.
2. Some machine learning platforms encourage the connection directly from the microcontroller.
If there was a resonable good internet connection, short videos and pictures could likely be uploaded directly. 

## Decision 
No for now. We will consider it for future scenarios to have a tighter integration of the camera.
