# ADR-015 Users Will Not Upload to Third-party Platforms Directly

## Status
Accepted

## Context
It seems tempting to move the load and to the user computer. However, if two or more different detection/training platforms are used, the same video has to be uploaded multiple times, which is certainly not intended.


## Decision 
No, user will not upload to third-party platforms link tensor flow directly. Central storage will be used.
